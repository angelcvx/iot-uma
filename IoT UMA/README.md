# Tasks Implementation Selector (TIS) and Optimal Tasks Assigment Framework (OTAF)

Scenarios 1 and 2 apply the OTAF to the IoT infrastructure installed at the School of Computer Science Engineering of the Universidad de Málaga. In the first scenario, the nodes reserve a fixed amount of resources dedicated to computation of offloaded tasks. In the second scenario, the nodes do not reserve specific resources for offloaded tasks, so the feasibility of the task offloading process and the reduction in energy consumption will depend on the current nodes workload (randomized in each experiment from 0 to their maximal capabilities). The deployed mobile application is named `La Universidad Aumentada'. This app, developed by the Universidad de Málaga, uses augmented reality to show motivational messages from successful students. These messages are visible by scanning QR (Quick Response) codes spread over the university.
