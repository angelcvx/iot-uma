# Benchmark version of the Tasks Implementation Selector (TIS) and Optimal Tasks Assignment Framework (OTAF) 

This Benchmark version of the TIS and OTAF allows setting the number of devices, tasks and configuration in the case of the TIS and devices and tasks in the case of the OTAF. The characteristics of the devices (CPU, RAM, workload, etc.) and tasks (connections, computational load, hardware and software requirements, time restrictions, etc.) are randomly generated.

## Requirements

- Python (https://www.python.org/). Remember to include python as environment variable. 
- Z3 solver for Python (https://pypi.org/project/z3-solver/).

## Usage

- Go to the modules directory and run:  <python .\script_name.py>
- Select the number of devices, tasks and configuration in the case of the TIS and devices and tasks in the case of the OTAF.
